## PROJECT RULES & CODING STANDARDS

### GENERAL PRINCIPLES
*   Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
*   Follow established conventions and best practices.
*   Prioritize code clarity and simplicity.
*   Ensure code is well-documented.

### CODE STYLE
*   Maintain consistent indentation and formatting.
*   Use meaningful variable and function and endpoint names.
*   Keep functions short and focused.
*   Avoid unnecessary complexity.

### API Design
*   When creating new API endpoints, ensure they are well-documented with docstrings, explaining the purpose, inputs, and outputs.
*   New API endpoints should include comprehensive statistics such as total units, total area, and total price. Breakdown by project should also be included where applicable, providing the same statistics for each project.
*   When creating new API endpoints, place them in the correct ViewSet (e.g., project related endpoints in ProjectViewSet).
*   When creating new API endpoints for financial calculations, follow the structure outlined below:
    *   Create a dedicated financial calculation service in `construction/calculations.py`.
    *   Implement API endpoints using `@action` in the relevant ViewSet (e.g., `construction/api.py`).
    *   Structure API responses to include relevant metrics (e.g., profit metrics, project statistics, investor analysis).
*   New API Endpoints:
    *   `Project/comprehensive_analysis/`: Provides a comprehensive project analysis.
    *   `Project/profit_metrics/`: Provides profit metrics (total, annual, monthly, daily).
    *   `Project/cost_metrics/`: Provides cost metrics.
    *   `Project/project_statistics_detailed/`: Provides detailed project statistics.
    *   `Investor/{id}/detailed_statistics/`: Provides detailed statistics for an investor.
    *   `Investor/{id}/ratios/`: Provides ratios for an investor.
    *   `Investor/all_investors_summary/`: Provides a summary of all investors.
    *   `Transaction/detailed_statistics/`: Provides detailed transaction statistics.

### COPYRIGHT NOTICE
*   Always include a copyright notice at the bottom of each page, linking to royasoftteam.ir, formatted as a professional footer. The footer should include the copyright year (currently 2024), a link to RoyaSoftTeam with a code icon, and be styled appropriately for the page (e.g., using Bootstrap). The footer should also be responsive and support dark/light themes where applicable, using CSS variables. The footer on authentication pages (e.g., login, registration) must be fixed to the bottom of the page.

### MODEL DEFINITIONS
*   When defining models, use DecimalFields with appropriate max_digits and decimal_places to ensure data integrity for numerical fields like "Total_Infrastructure" and "Correction_factor".
    *   For "Total_Infrastructure", use `max_digits=15` and `decimal_places=2`.
    *   For "Correction_factor", use `max_digits=20` and `decimal_places=10`.
*   Always include verbose names and help texts for each field to improve readability and usability in forms and admin interfaces.

### FORM HANDLING
*   When creating forms, ensure that new model fields are included and properly configured.
*   Use appropriate widgets (e.g., `NumberInput`) with relevant attributes (e.g., `class`, `placeholder`, `step`) for each form field.
*   Set `required=False` if the field is not mandatory.
*   Ensure the form's `Meta` class includes all relevant fields in the `fields` attribute.

### TEMPLATE UPDATES
*   When updating templates, ensure that new fields are displayed correctly using the form's rendering mechanism (e.g., `{{ form.field_name }}`).
*   Include labels and help texts for each field to provide context to the user.
*   Use appropriate HTML structure (e.g., `div`, `form-group`, `col-md-6`) to ensure proper layout and responsiveness.

### NUMBER FORMATTING
*   All numbers in the application must **always** be displayed in English with a 3-digit separator (thousands separator). Use `new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(Math.round(num))` to achieve this.

### CARD STYLING FOR PRICE FIGURES
*   On cards that display price-related figures, such as "Building Value (Toman)", "Net Cost Per Meter (Toman/m²)", "Gross Cost Per Meter (Toman/m²)", "Building Value(per meter)(Toman/m²)", "مبلغ سود نهایی(تومان)", and "درصد سودکل", the numbers must be displayed using a larger font size (2.2rem for desktop, 1.6rem for mobile) to improve readability, and the containing cards should be larger (width 1.5x to 2x) compared to other cards. Specifically:
    *   For price-related figures, use a larger font size (2.2rem for desktop, 1.6rem for mobile).
    *   The cards containing these figures should also have width 1.5x to 2x compared to other cards (depending on the specific card).

### TOOLTIP IMPLEMENTATION
*   For cards requiring explanations, implement a tooltip system using an information icon (e.g., `<i>` tag with a Font Awesome info icon) positioned at the top-left of the card. The tooltip font must be Vazir to match the rest of the page.
*   The tooltip should appear on click, displaying the necessary explanation. Ensure the tooltip is styled appropriately and positioned correctly within the card. Tooltips should be implemented such that only one tooltip is visible at any time. Clicking outside the card, scrolling, or resizing the window should close the tooltip.
*   Ensure that tooltips display correctly without being cut off and that the layout is responsive.

### SERIALIZER DEFINITIONS
*   Ensure that serializers are defined before they are used in other serializers to avoid "not defined" errors. When encountering such errors, reorder the serializer definitions to ensure dependencies are met.
*   When creating serializers for models, include all relevant fields (e.g. period and period_weight in ExpenseSerializer), defining methods where necessary to retrieve related data.

### TEMPLATE MODIFICATIONS
*   When requested to remove a specific card and its associated JavaScript code (e.g., "هزینه تمام شده(متری)"), perform the following steps:
    1.  Locate and remove the corresponding HTML element (card) from the relevant template file.
    2.  Identify and remove any JavaScript code that is specifically related to the removed card. This includes event listeners, data processing functions, and any other code that directly interacts with the card.

### SERVER-SIDE CALCULATIONS
*   Whenever possible, move complex calculations from the client-side (JavaScript) to the server-side (Django). This ensures data integrity, improves performance, and centralizes business logic.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  Identify calculations currently performed in JavaScript that should be moved to the server.
    2.  Create a dedicated financial calculation service in `construction/calculations.py` to encapsulate these calculations.
    3.  Develop new API endpoints to expose the results of these server-side calculations.
    4.  Update the front-end to consume the new API endpoints and remove the corresponding JavaScript code.
    5.  Thoroughly test and optimize the new implementation.
*   A large number of calculations (over 50) are currently performed in JavaScript and should be migrated to the server-side. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **Project Dashboard Calculations:**
        *   Calculating available capital (total deposits - total withdrawals).
        *   Calculating total profit.

*   **Implemented Calculations:** The list of implemented calculations is stored in `IMPLEMENTED_CALCULATIONS.md`.
*   **Checking Server-Side Calculations:** To determine if a calculation exists on the server-side, follow these steps:
    1.  **Comprehensive Documentation:** Consult `docs/FINANCIAL_CALCULATIONS.md` for a complete list of calculations.
    2.  **Automated Script:** Run `scripts/check_calculations.py` to verify the presence and functionality of server-side calculations.
    3.  **Code Review:** Examine `construction/calculations.py` for calculation classes and `static/js/financial-calculations.js` for JavaScript service usage.
    4.  **API Endpoints:** Review available API endpoints and test them using `curl`.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
*   (Define the project workflow, including branching strategies, pull request procedures, and code review guidelines.)
*   (Specify the release process, including versioning, testing, and deployment.)

## DEBUGGING
*   (Describe debugging strategies and tools.)

## TESTING
*   (Define testing procedures and standards.)

## BACKUP AND RECOVERY
*   Ensure that the backup process covers all models defined in the `construction` app.
*   Verify that the backup process includes models defined in the `backup` app.
*   The backup process must include the following models:
    *   Models in `construction`: `Project`, `Unit`, `Investor`, `Period`, `InterestRate`, `Transaction`, `Expense`, `Sale`, `UserProfile`.
    *   Models in `backup`: `BackupRecord`, `BackupSettings`.
    *   Models in `security_monitoring`: `SecurityEvent`.
*   When creating a new backup, if the process stops and throws an error related to `SecurityEvent`, follow these steps:
    1.  Check the import statements in `create_backup.py` for `SecurityEvent`. Ensure that the import path is correct, pointing to the correct location of the `SecurityEvent` model (e.g., `security_monitoring.py`).
    2.  If the `SecurityEvent` model is causing issues, exclude it from the backup process by:
        *   Removing or commenting out the import statement for `SecurityEvent` in `create_backup.py`.
        *   Removing or commenting out the lines related to `security_events` in the `get_database_stats` function within `create_backup.py`.
        *   Removing or commenting out the lines related to `security_events.json` in the list of files created by the backup script within `create_backup.py`.
        *   Excluding the `construction.securityevent` model when creating the complete database fixture using the `--exclude` option.
        *   Adjusting the expected number of individual fixtures and the corresponding success message in `create_backup.py`.

## CURSOR RULES
*   A comprehensive rules file for financial calculations has been created and stored in `.cursor/rules` to ensure consistent usage of these calculations across the project.
